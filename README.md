# Desmos Script
Adds extra functionalities to Desmos Graphing Calculator, like changing color directly from a color picker!

# How to Use
In order to use the script, you have to copy the [source code](src/color-picker-gui.js) then you paste it in the web console while using [Desmos](https://www.desmos.com/calculator) in your desktop browser.

In the latest branch the script has been refactored as a user-script with TamperMonkey. If you already have that extension or are familiar with user-scripts, go ahead and install it on your own. If you prefer to wait for detailed instructions and automatic updates, its coming soon!
